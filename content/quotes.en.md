This is because the answer is always simple with fascism: generally a death threat towards the marginalized group of the day will do just fine, which easily fits into 280 characters: “Storm the capitol building!”? “Hang Mike Pence!”? Yep, even congressional members and vice presidents can be marginalized under the right circumstances, and it’s under 280 characters. - [Source](https://ariadne.space/2022/10/27/the-internet-is-broken-due-to-structural-injustice/)

> because high infant mortality and no birth control— that takes out your
> 16-40yo female demographic who would otherwise be having a say in
> leadership/positions of power. Meanwhile all the same men in that demographic
> who were not constantly stuck with this exhausting deadly job were traipsing
> around playing war and king and big boss with all their free time for
> thousands of years and a societal structure was created favoring these roles.
> Now that the playing field has slowly, finally evened out some in the past 100

> He sees it all personified in Lee Kuan Yew, who “honestly thought that money

> Mercantilists(The British), Democratic Socialism(Bernie Sanders types in the
