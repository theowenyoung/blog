This is because the answer is always simple with fascism: generally a death threat towards the marginalized group of the day will do just fine, which easily fits into 280 characters: “Storm the capitol building!”? “Hang Mike Pence!”? Yep, even congressional members and vice presidents can be marginalized under the right circumstances, and it’s under 280 characters. - [Source](https://ariadne.space/2022/10/27/the-internet-is-broken-due-to-structural-injustice/)

> because high infant mortality and no birth control— that takes out your
> 16-40yo female demographic who would otherwise be having a say in

> who were not constantly stuck with this exhausting deadly job were traipsing
> around playing war and king and big boss with all their free time for
> thousands of years and a societal structure was created favoring these roles.
> Now that the playing field has slowly, finally evened out some in the past 100

> He sees it all personified in Lee Kuan Yew, who “honestly thought that money
> and status equated to happiness … His failure to understand how false that was
> really showed, leading us to become one of the richest countries in the world,

> It is by how he creates a place where people are able to live happily and
> prosper based on their own unique attributes. And he hasn’t.” --

> Mercantilists(The British), Democratic Socialism(Bernie Sanders types in the
> US; many of the Nordics), and a whole host of things in between. Democracy and
> Capitalism are two separate axes creating a plane, rather than two sides of
> the same axis. --
