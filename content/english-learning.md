## 轻松英语

轻松学习英语的 7 条规则

1. 学习短语而不是单词

   - 准备一个短语笔记本，随时记下短语

2. 学习语法会扼杀你的口语
3. 用耳朵学习，而不是用眼睛学习。
4. 重复是掌握口语的关键
5. 直观和无意识地学习语法
6. 学习真正的英语，而不是教科书上的英语
7. 用引入入胜的故事学英语

- 通过专注于母语人士使用的正宗英语材料来学习真正的英语
- 通过听和答的故事学习用英语思考，训练你自动回答，无需翻译

## 永远流利

- 立刻获取以下东西：

  1. 获取一本语法参考书，但是跳过 90%的练习，仅作为参考。
  2. 获取一本英汉词典以及一本英英词典。
  3. 一本主题词汇书，这样可以获取类似的词语。
  4. [频率词典](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Frequency-Dictionaries/book-series/RFD)

     - [GSL 单词列表](http://jbauman.com/gsl.html)

  5. 短语集合

- 大量听能理解的东西，遇到不认识的单词，先听，先学会读，然后才去找他的意思
- 结合图像，结合生活中的东西，人物，联系起来，比如谷歌图片，或者个人的记忆
- 用别人做好的卡片集合记单词没有用，因为这不是你的个人经验集合，相反，你应该自己创造你自己的卡片集合。卡片构建过程是学习语言最有趣和最令人满意的方式之一。
- 语言学习的三个基本关键：

  1. 首先学习发音。
  2. 不要翻译。
  3. 使用间隔重复系统。

- 死记硬背是无聊的，它不适用于长期记忆。
- 不要复习，要用回忆。

  - 这里的意思是说不要单纯的读一个句子，试着靠回忆把这个句子写下来。

- 通过创建四种类型的连接来实现记忆：结构，声音，概念和个人连接。心理学家在 1970
  年代发现了它们，他们创建了一个奇怪的问卷，其中包含四种类型的问题，并将其交给大学生：

  - 结构：BEAR 这个词中有多少个大写字母？
  - 声音：苹果与 Snapple 押韵吗？
  - 概念：TOOL 是"仪器"的另一个词吗？
  - 个人联系：你喜欢披萨吗？

- 图像回忆研究一再证明，我们的视觉记忆是惊人的。1960
  年代，记忆研究人员对大学生进行了有史以来最可怕的记忆测试之一：两种选择强制选择测试。在其中，大学生被展示了 612
  个杂志广告（可能被绑在椅子上，睁着眼睛），然后被要求在展示新的混合图像时识别旧照片。学生们在
  98.5%的时间内正确挑选了旧图像。由于不满意，研究人员用更多的图像重复了他们的测试，试图确定大学生会忍受低薪和免费食物。似乎没有限制。学生们愿意连续五天坐在黑暗的房间里，连续观看一万张图片。研究结束后，这些学生准确地识别了
  83%的图像。我们的视觉记忆能力是非凡的;我们只需要学习如何利用它。

- 你永远不会只在 Anki 下载一个别人的整理好的集合，然后就神奇地学会一门语言。为什么？Anki
  卡片在让你记住你自己的东西方面非常出色，如果是别人的，那几乎没什么作用。你在看过别人的卡片时，你可能不会自发地想到你童年的猫或谷歌图片搜索这个词时出现的众多史莱克：穿靴子的猫的图像。没有电影，没有声音，也没有故事。在这种情况下，当你在上班的路上忙着学习时，你将很难形成一个深刻的、多感官的记忆。这不是
  SRS 的错;这是语言游戏的本质。

- 你有没有通过写出笔记摘要来学习考试？它工作得很好，不是吗？当你创造一些东西时，它就成为你的一部分。相反，如果你只是抄袭别人的笔记，你就不会受益匪浅。当你试图记住别人的作品时，你正在与大脑的过滤器进行一场艰苦的战斗。

- 传统的语言课程失败的原因之一就是没有人能给你属于你自己的一门语言，你必须自己创建它。你语言中的每个单词都得是你自己的才行。像 Rosetta Stone
  这样的程序可以为像球和大象这样的单词提供体面的原创体验，但最终，你需要处理像经济状况这样的单词。像这样的抽象单词需要复杂的个人联系，如果你要在说话时舒适地使用它们的话。你必须为自己建立这些联系，因为没有人能告诉你当前的经济状况如何影响了你。

- 你的大脑天生就会忽略外来声音之间的差异。要重新连接它，请用目标语言听最小的单词对（类似发音的 2 个单词），如 niece 和 knee -
  并测试自己，直到你的大脑适应听到这些新的声音。这里有一个 Anki
  资源很好用：<https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/525138553>

- 歌手首先学习发音，因此，我们不必与多年的坏习惯作斗争。在我们知道单词的含义之前，我们学会了准确地模仿单词，这样我们就可以在不让自己尴尬的情况下登上舞台。你也应该这样做。如果你等到以后再处理你的口音，你将失去你词汇中的每个单词数百（或数千次）。

- 如果有长单词，可以分段练，先从词尾开始一小节一小节连，最后连起来。

## 常见英文连读

- Think of it
- All of us
- it'll be fine
- out of -> outta
- I don't want to get into -> I don wanna get into
- lives up
- make an appointment

## 冷知识

## Common Expression

- There's a wonderful line I came across -> There's a wonderful quote I found
- My girlfriend is on her period.
- Tens of millions of Chinese are currently unable to leave their homes. All
  face being taken to isolation centres, should they test positive or be
  declared close contacts of a virus-carrier. A grim fate for anyone,
  centralised quarantine is terrifying for pet-owners, who must scramble to find
  a shelter or someone to foster their animals. If they fail, the creatures may
  starve in an empty flat or—as has happened in several cities—be bludgeoned to
  death by workers sent to disinfect homes.
- Never that will happen.
- Do you often work overtime in your company?

## Advanced

### Apologizing

Don’t be upset, but . . .

It was a slip of the tongue.

I said it by mistake.

I am sorry that . . .

### (Dis)agreeing

One hundred percent.

Without question.

Exactly right.

Most certainly.

Without doubt.

In no way . . .

That isn’t true at all.

That is an exaggeration.

I really can’t believe that.

In principle that is true, but . . .

Admittedly that is true, but . . .

That’s one way to say it.

Only up to a certain point.

Certainly. Why not?

I agree.

### Closing

That is all there is to say.

That is all for now.

To sum up . . .

And there is the problem.

I hope it is only a matter of time.

That remains to be seen.

### Filer

Understandably.

Frankly speaking . . .

Between you and me . . .

Anyway . . .

Well then . . .

Well, as a matter of fact . . .

How can I put it?

I must say that . . .

First . . .

Second . . .

I would like you to know that . . .

I am afraid that . . .

Now and then it seems to me that . . .

After all . . .

As far as I am concerned . . .

More and more . . .

Actually . . .

All joking aside . . .

Now seriously . . .

### Elaborating

To be more precise . . .

And what’s more . . .

Since I am already talking about it . . .

I would like to emphasize that . . .

Should I explain in greater detail?

Allow me to say it another way.

That is to say . . .

Nevertheless . . .

Even though . . .

That sounds like . . .

And that is why . . .

### Opening

Thank you very much.

That is a good question.

That is such a difficult question.

Once upon a time, long ago . . .

### Passing

Can you tell me please . . . ?

Would you be interested in us talking about something else?

And what do you think?

### Qualifying

To tell you the truth . . .

I presume that . . .

I hope that . . .

In my opinion . . .

If that is true . . .

I don’t know exactly.

I would like to think that . . .

The way I see it is that . . .

As you may know . . .

I don’t have a big interest in that.

If I understand correctly . . .

As you already know . . .

That isn’t such a big problem.

That is a matter of opinion.

As far as I know . . .

I have the impression that . . .

It is usually true that . . .

You never know, but . . .

I haven’t thought about it before, but . . .

If I am not mistaken . . .

I am not certain whether . . .

Like every other man/woman . . .

I have my own opinion on it, but . . .

I am not an expert, but . . .

### Quoting

He/she said something like . . .

My wife/husband pointed out that . . .

Recently, I heard that . . .

My better half said . . .

### Switching

Now it occurs to me that . . .

By the way . . .

I have an interesting story about it.

And besides that . . .

Oh, I nearly forgot . . .

And one more thing . . .

On the other hand . . .
