I established a personal public [Wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com/) and [Blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com/) before, which let me develop the habit of taking notes and writing more things, as the habit has been developed, so I will no longer entangle the form of the blog problem, put Personal notes, all the outputs of the blog are placed here, so that I can maintain myself better and save my mind, before the two places to switch back and forth to make me a bit overwhelmed. Currently, all blog sources are placed in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/theowenyoung/blog).

I'm using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theowenyoung.foam-lite-vscode) I developed to edit all the content of this blog. I prefer text-assisted input tools to software that modifies the formatting of my original data. It gives me more control as well as not being locked out by the operator.

I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to generate this static blog, Zola is written in Rust, I've basically used JS toolchain to generate the blog before, now I prefer to use a one-stop tool, mainly because I'm scared of the third-party plugin ecosystem, and I want to keep my blog Zola actually provides a lot of capabilities, so it's possible to implement most of the ideas, for example, I implemented this function for sorting books by rating: [books](/content/pages/books.md)

## About Me

### A failure of English learning

I've learned English more than 10 years, but it still sucks, so I registered a Twitter [@TheOwenYoung](https://twitter.com/TheOwenYoung) for only English tweets, and this [wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com) and [blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com) to force me to use more English.
