I established a personal public [Wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com/) and
[Blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com/) before, which let me develop the habit of
taking notes and writing more things, as the habit has been developed, so I will
no longer entangle the form of the blog problem, put Personal notes, all the
outputs of the blog are placed here, so that I can maintain myself better and
save my mind, before the two places to switch back and forth to make me a bit
overwhelmed. Currently, all blog sources are placed in the
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/theowenyoung/blog).

I'm using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
[Foam Lite Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theowenyoung.foam-lite-vscode)
I developed to edit all the content of this blog. I prefer plain text to store
notes, it gives me more control as well as not being locked out by the operator.

I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to generate this static blog, Zola is
written in Rust, I've basically used JS toolchain to generate the blog before,
now I prefer to use a single binary tool, mainly because I'm scared of the
third-party plugin ecosystem, and I want to keep my blog Zola actually provides
a lot of capabilities, so it's possible to implement most of the ideas, for
example, I implemented this function for sorting books by rating:
[books](@content/pages/books.md), Indieweb capabilities:
[Now, I'm in IndieWeb?](@content/blog/indieweb.en.md)

## About Me

### A failure of English learning

I've learned English more than 10 years, but it still sucks, so I registered a
Twitter [@TheOwenYoung](https://twitter.com/TheOwenYoung) for only English
tweets, and this [wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com) and
[blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com) to force me to use more English.
